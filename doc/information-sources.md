- Moveit2 is a work in progress, so it can often be interesting to go to the Moveit1 tutorials -> https://ros-planning.github.io/moveit_tutorials/

- in particular, the Setup Assistant and the python bindings of the Move Group interface are not yet available.

see [here](moveit-motion-planning.md) for some information about motion planning in moveit. See [here](moveit-architecture) for some information about a 101 of the moveit framework.
