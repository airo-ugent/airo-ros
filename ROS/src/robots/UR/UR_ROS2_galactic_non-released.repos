# https://github.com/UniversalRobots/Universal_Robots_ROS2_Driver/blob/main/MoveIt_Support.repos
# note that in particular the ros2_control and ros2_controllers packages were not included and are installed from binaries.
# this is to reduce the amount of code built from source, but if something is failing with the control stack this might be the cause.
